# Getting Started

One of the best ways to learn about the project, take a look through the [README](README.md) to see the categories, best practices and standards we're currently working with.

# How to get involved
Ready to jump in?  Great!   Here are some ways you can help:
- typos

- translation

## Found an Issue?
If you find a bug in the source code or a mistake in the documentation, you can help us by
[submitting an issue](#submit-issue) to the GitHub Repository. Even better, you can
[submit a Pull Request](#submit-pr) with a fix.

## <a name="submit"></a> Submission Guidelines

### <a name="submit-issue"></a> Submitting an Issue
Before you submit an issue, search the archive, maybe your question was already answered.

If your issue appears to be a bug, and hasn't been reported, open a new issue.
Help us to maximize the effort we can spend fixing issues and adding new
features, by not reporting duplicate issues.  


## Share what you learn!
Another great way to help this project is to blog about your experience, and what you've learned in a blog post to bring others in to collaborate, test and learn.
