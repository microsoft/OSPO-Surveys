## Question Standards

Something we learned in previous surveys is that providing a *'Neither Agree Nor Disagree'* option, dilutes the responses if a large number of people opt for that.   It really tells us nothing and makes the other responses less actionable. As a result the question standard for agreement is structured this way:
- Strongly Agree
- Agree
- Disagree
- Strongly Disagree
- Other _______________________

With 'Other' being a place people can elborate on why none of those responses fit.

## Question Best Practices

* Each section should include a final question 'If you would like, please use this space to expand your answers about the [Section Area].'
* Unless you have a specific need to know *who* responded in what way, provide an option for people to respond anonymously to encourage honestly.
* All surveys run on behalf of an Open Source Program's Office (OSPO) should include privacy and data retention policy.
* Unless otherwise agreed upon by your legal and HR team, **no senstive information should be collected including dimensions of diversity**. 
* Should you run an external-facing survey you can sometimes asking questions about diversity dimensions, but only if there ais no personally identifying information including location. For more running external surveys please reach out to the [CHAOSS DEI working group](https://github.com/chaoss/wg-dei).
