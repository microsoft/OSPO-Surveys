# InnerSource Participation
The goal of this question is to understand how recently, and in what capacity people have participated in InnerSource activities.   
People may have previous experience longer than a year ago, but getting at their longer history would be a different thpe of question.

Not everyone will be sure of which projects are InnerSource, providing a list would be helpful.

**NOTE: Contributing to InnerSource means contributing to a project that has not been publically released, and does does not have an open source license.**
