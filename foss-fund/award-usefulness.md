# Award Usefulness
This is to help undestand ways in which funding helps (or rather to test hypothesis around that).
We also want to understand what blockers might be to using funds.


**How was the FOSS Fund award most useful to your project?**
*Note: there is no 'right or preferred way' for funds to be used, the goal of this question is to understand where the fund has been helpful so we can perhaps do more in that area for future.*
- I haven’t used it yet
- Travel to an event
- Hired a contractor
- Sponsored another community member/maintainer
- Created design assets
- Living expenses 
- Training, coaching
- Technology or services
- Other ___________

**If you answered ‘I haven’t used it’, please use this space to describe any obstacles or challenges you’ve experienced in allocating the funds**
