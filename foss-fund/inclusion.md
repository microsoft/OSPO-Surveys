# Inclusion
For Funds encouraging nomination of projects actively working on diversity, equity and inclusion this question can help draw out the challenges people are facing, or problem areas they are interested in working on.

**Recently [COMPANY] has added ‘projects that advance diversity, equity and inclusion’ in open source as a category for nomination.  How do you think we could better support inclusion in your project?**
